# ndarray.transpose(*axes)

#   Returns a view of the array with axes transposed.
#
#   For a 1-D array this has no effect, as a transposed vector is simply the same vector.
#
#   Parameters:
#       axes : None, tuple of ints, or n ints
#           None or no argument: reverses the order of the axes.
