# numpy.reshape(a, new_shape, order='C')
#       Gives a new shape to an array without changing its data.
#           Parameters:
#               a : array_like
#                   Array to be reshaped.
#
#               new_shape : int or tuple of ints
#                   The new shape should be compatible with the original shape.
#                   If an integer, then the result will be a 1-D array of that length.
#                   One shape dimension can be -1.
#                   In this case, the value is inferred from the length of the array and
#                   remaining dimensions.
