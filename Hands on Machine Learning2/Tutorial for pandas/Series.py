import pandas as pd

# The pandas library contains these useful data structures:
#
# Series objects, that we will discuss now. A Series object is 1D array, similar to a column in a spreadsheet (with a
# column name and row labels).
# DataFrame objects. This is a 2D table, similar to a spreadsheet (with column names and
# row labels).

# Creating a Series
series = pd.Series([2, -1, 3, 5]);
print(series);
